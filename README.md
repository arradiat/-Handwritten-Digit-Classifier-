# -Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-
 The aim of this project is to study the ability of several machine learning algorithms for building a handwritten digit classifier. The dataset contains a sample of handwritten digits. Each digit is described by an array of 8x8 pixels in normalized grayscale. Each line of the dataset is composed 64 explanatory variables each of them representing a gray level and the target variable being the digit. We are going to start by having a first look of our dataset, then we’re gonna try out multiple ML algorithms and evaluate their performance in order to choose the most suitable one for our problem and finally we’re going to proceed with a variable selection to find out which pixels are more important for the digit recognition and see if selecting them can improve our learning algorithms
